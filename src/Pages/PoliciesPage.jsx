                to deny this application for any reason.
                <br /> I understand that Strong Hearts Sanctuary is not able to
                guarantee the health or temperament of any animal, as many
                animals come in with unknown histories. <br />
                There are traits that could change upon adoption, and I take
                responsibility to care for and address these issues if they do
                arise.
                <br /> I understand that anything could happen in life, and if I

                Strong Hearts Sanctuary does not accept private surrenders. Our
                resources are primarily allocated to the animals already under
                our care, and we work diligently to ensure their wellbeing and
                happiness. As such, we are unable to accommodate requests for
                the surrender of animals from individuals of the public.
                <h2 className="pt-4 text-lg">Exceptions</h2>
                The only exception to this policy is when an animal was
                previously in our care and must be surrendered by the adopter.
                In such cases, we understand that circumstances can change, and
                we are committed to assisting in the best interests of the
                animal. If you adopted an animal from Strong Hearts Sanctuary
                and find yourself in a situation where you can no longer provide
                appropriate care, please contact us via the contact page for

                We understand that there are situations where individuals may
                need to surrender an animal for various reasons. While we are
                unable to directly accept private surrenders, we encourage you
                to consider looking for a local animal shelter or rescue
                organisation that has a 'no kill' policy. These organisations
                are committed to providing care and finding loving homes for
                animals without euthanizing them due to space or time
                constraints. <br /> Strong Hearts Sanctuary remains dedicated to
                the welfare of animals and strives to make a lasting impact
                through our rescue efforts. We appreciate your understanding of
                our surrender policy and encourage you to reach out to us for
                any questions or concerns regarding animal welfare. â€‹Thank you

                (excluding accidents), which is supported by a statement from a

                proprietors (Strong Hearts Sanctuary) must accept the animal
                back and refund the full purchase price of the animal. <br /> If

                the proprietor must refund 75% of the purchase price or offer a

                the point of sale, the proprietor must refund the purchase price

                We believe in prioritising the wellbeing and social development
                of our kittens. This policy requires that kittens under 10
                months of age be adopted in pairs, with a littermate, or into a
                home that already includes a friendly resident cat. <br /> This
                policy is rooted in our understanding of "single kitten
                syndrome." Kittens raised without feline companionship are more
                likely to face behavioural and socialisation challenges as they
                grow.

                  Understanding "Single Kitten Syndrome"
                </h2>
                Kittens, particularly those under 10 months old, are highly
                social animals. They thrive when they have feline companions to
                interact with and learn from. When kittens are raised without
                feline companionship, they are more likely to develop
                behavioural issues, including excessive attachment to owners,
                demanding behaviour, and an increased risk of developing
                destructive habits due to a lack of social interaction with
                their own species.{" "}

                  The benefits of feline companionship
                </h2>{" "}
                When kittens have a feline friend to interact with, they
                naturally learn vital social and communication skills essential
                for their wellbeing, resulting in a better adjustment to
                adulthood, increased happiness, and the development of healthier
                and more harmonious relationships with their human families.{" "}

                households with resident cats, we create an environment that
                promotes their overall happiness and balanced development.{" "}

                  At Strong Hearts Sanctuary, the wellbeing and safety of our

                  Why we are indoor only There are numerous reasons to keep your

                  <li>
                    Safety: Outdoor cats are exposed to dangers such as traffic
                    accidents, diseases from other animals, and attacks by other
                    larger predators.

                  <li>
                    Health: Outdoor cats are at a higher risk of injuries,
                    infections, and parasites. Things they would not be exposed
                    to if they did not go outside.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Fighting: Outdoor cats often get into territorial disputes
                    and fights with other cats, leading to injuries.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lost and stolen: Cats can easily become lost or stolen when

                    Protection of Australia's native animals: Domesticated cats
                    still kill an estimated 546 million animals in Australia
                    every year. An estimated 71% of all pet cats in Australia
                    are able to roam â€“ of this figure, 78% of roaming cats hunt.
                    Most animals â€“ an estimated 85% â€“ killed by pet cats are not
                    brought home.

                    Curfews: In Victoria, at least 38 local governments have
                    implemented either dusk-to-dawn or 24-hour cat containment
                    policies. So why let them outside at all?

                  â€‹â€‹Cats are incredibly adaptable creatures and can lead
                  fulfilling lives indoors when provided with the right
                  environment and stimulation. While it might seem like cats
                  need outdoor access, there is endless evidence to suggest that
                  keeping them indoors is essential for their health and safety.

                    "Supervising" your cat while its outside
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    While some cat owners may attempt to supervise their cats
                    outdoors, it's important to acknowledge that cats are
                    incredibly agile and can easily outmanoeuvre even the most
                    attentive human supervisors. Here are some reasons why we
                    believe simply "supervising" a cat while it's outside is not
                    sufficient: - â€‹Cats are remarkably fast and can quickly dart
                    away from their owners, making it challenging to react in
                    time to prevent potential dangers. - Cats are natural
                    climbers and can scale trees, fences, and other structures
                    with ease, potentially putting themselves in high-risk
                    situations. - Cats have a strong instinct to explore their
                    surroundings, and their curiosity can lead them into
                    unexpected and potentially hazardous situations. -
                    Unforeseen events like loud noises, sudden movements, or the
                    presence of other animals can startle a cat, causing them to
                    react unpredictably and potentially run into danger. - Even
                    the most vigilant cat owners cannot control all the
                    variables and potential dangers in an outdoor environment,
                    such as traffic or encounters with aggressive wildlife.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given these challenges, we insist that our adopters provide
                    indoor cats with a safe and enriched environment that
                    satisfies their need for mental and physical stimulation,
                    rather than attempting to supervise outdoor excursions
                    (unless it is on a harness or within a purpose-built cat
                    enclosure). This approach ensures the cat's safety while
                    also minimising the potential risks associated with outdoor
                    access.

                  <p>
                    Cats are known for their jumping abilities, and the height
                    of a fence needed to prevent a cat from jumping over it can
                    vary depending on the individual cat's athleticism and
                    motivation. <br /> A typical minimum height for a cat-proof
                    fence is at least 6 feet (approximately 1.8 meters). This
                    height should deter most (but certainly not all) cats from
                    attempting to jump over the fence. This assumes that there
                    are no nearby trees, structures, or objects that a cat could
                    use as a launching point to jump over the fence.

                      accidents, exposure to diseases from other animals, and
                      attacks by predators. By keeping our cats indoors, we
                      protect them from these risks, ensuring their safety.

                      Indoor cats are less likely to get into fights with other
                      cats or native wildlife or cause damage to neighbours'
                      property, fostering better community relations.

                      On average indoor only cats live on average 10 years
                      longer than free-range cats.
