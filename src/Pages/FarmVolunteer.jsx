              sow seeds of kindness that blossom into a brighter future. It
              costs nothing to be kind or compassionate, a peaceful world begins
              when we include all in our care.

              Volunteering is a rewarding experience that involves a lot of
              compassion and perhaps a little bit of hard-work. Anyone can
              volunteer, our volunteers receive plenty of support and
              opportunities to learn. No prior experience is needed to become a
              volunteer, just a full heart and maybe some gumboots. Join us
              today!
