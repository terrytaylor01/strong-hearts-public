# Strong Hearts Sanctuary Website

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Strong Hearts Sanctuary website. This project was a comprehensive endeavor to create a dynamic, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly website for a local animal rescue organization with multiple branches. Each branch has its own unique branding, which was a key consideration during the development process.

## Deployment

## Technologies Used
The website was built using a combination of modern technologies to ensure performance, security, and maintainability. The core technologies used include:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Cloudflare's Edge Functionality**: Used to securely call REST APIs and protect API secrets.

- **Figma**: Design software to loosely create the core UI of the site.

## Design
The design process was a critical part of this project. All designs were created in Figma, with a focus on maintaining the unique branding of each branch of the organization. The goal was to create a cohesive yet distinct look and feel for each branch, resulting in a visually appealing website that aligns with the organization's brand image.

## Features
The website boasts a range of features designed to enhance user experience and functionality:

- **Responsive Design**: The website was designed with accessibility and responsiveness in mind, ensuring it can be easily navigated by various users on different devices. A responsive navbar and nav menu were implemented, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.
- **Dynamic Animal Adoption Pages**: The website integrates with PetRescue's REST API to dynamically display animals up for adoption. This feature allows for real-time updates as animals are added or removed from PetRescue.
- **Infinite Scrolling and Filtering**: The animal listings page includes infinite scrolling functionality and the ability to filter listings by species, providing a seamless browsing experience for users.
- **Scrolling Carousels**: The website features scrolling carousels of animal profiles, which required working with external HTML functionality such as scroll positions. States were used to ensure the functionality of the arrows showing up properly when at the limits of the carousel.
- **Contact Form**: A user-friendly contact form was implemented using Formspark, offering robust spam protection and ease of use for the organization.
- **Donation Page**: The donation page integrates with ShoutForGood, a fundraising and donation merchant that works with charities, providing a practical and realistic function for a commercial/public-facing website.

## Reflection
This project presented several rewarding challenges and learning opportunities. The scale of the project provided an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to handle complex, large-scale projects with many different routes, components and assets, a crucial skill for a front-end developer.

Working closely with the rescue organization was a key aspect of this project. Ensuring their satisfaction required regular communication, understanding their needs, and translating those needs into a functional and aesthetically pleasing website. This experience underscores the importance of client engagement and satisfaction in the industry.

The project also highlighted the importance of adaptability and problem-solving skills. From implementing different themes for each branch to creating a serverless “backend” for API secret protection, each challenge was met with a solution that enhanced the overall functionality of the website.

Moreover, the project showcases my ability to integrate third-party services into a website, a valuable skill in today’s interconnected digital landscape. The use of Formspark and ShoutForGood demonstrates a practical understanding of how to leverage external platforms to enhance a website’s functionality.

The successful deployment of the site using Cloudflare Pages not only shows my skills in automatic building and deployment from a GitHub repository but also my ability to choose cost-effective and efficient solutions.

Overall, this project serves as a testament to my skills as a front-end developer. It demonstrates my ability to design and develop a large-scale, aesthetically pleasing website that ties into the brand image, while also implementing practical and realistic functions in a commercial/public-facing website. It showcases my organizational skills, client engagement, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of modern web technologies and third-party services.
